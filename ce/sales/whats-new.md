# What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Sales

Wondering about upcoming and recently released capabilities in Dynamics 365 Sales? [Check out the release planner site](https://experience.dynamics.com/releaseplans/?app=sales). 

This article summarizes early access, public preview, and general availability features that were released in the last three months. The monthly release sections contain only those features that were deployed in all regions in that month. For example, if your Dynamics 365 org is in Canada, you'll receive the feature updates a few weeks earlier than the orgs in North America but the monthly release section will list that feature only after it's deployed in North America. For more information about the release schedule, see [Released versions of Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise](/dynamics365/released-versions/dynamics365sales#latest-version-availability).
