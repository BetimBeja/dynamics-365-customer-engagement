# Stay ahead with Copilot

Stay ahead of your work by asking Copilot to help you prepare for meetings and catch up on emails that need your attention.

## Prepare for upcoming sales appointments

If you have meetings scheduled on your calendar in the next 24 hours, Copilot can help you prepare for them. Go into your meetings with a helpful summary of notes from the last three months and the most recent email thread on the timeline of the related record.

1. [Open Copilot](use-sales-copilot.md#open-copilot).
1. Select the sparkle icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/sparkle-icon.png" border="false":::) and select **Stay ahead** >  **Prepare for sales appointments**.

    - If you have a record open, Copilot lists sales appointments in the next 24 hours that are related to that record.
    - If you're in the grid view, Copilot lists all your sales appointments in the next 24 hours.

1. From the list of sales appointments, hover over the meeting that you'd like to prepare for and select **Prepare**.

    If you only have one meeting coming up in the next 24 hours, it's summarized automatically.

## Show emails you haven't replied to

Copilot can help make sure that you don't miss important emails by reminding you of any that you haven't replied to.

1. [Open Copilot](use-sales-copilot.md#open-copilot).
1. Select the sparkle icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/sparkle-icon.png" border="false":::) and select **Stay ahead** >  **Show emails that need follow up**.

    - If you have a record open, Copilot lists unanswered emails related to the record.
    - If you're in the grid view, Copilot lists all your unanswered emails.

To be included in the list, emails must meet the following criteria:

- They've been in your mailbox, unanswered, for the past three to seven days. Email that's been unanswered for longer than seven days falls off the list.
- They contain a buying intent, a question, a query, or an action item.
- They have the **Regarding** field as a lead or an opportunity.
