# Stay ahead with Copilot

Stay ahead of your work by asking Copilot to help you prepare for meetings and catch up on emails that need your attention.

## Prepare for upcoming sales appointments

If you have meetings scheduled on your calendar in the next 24 hours, Copilot can help you prepare for them. Go into your meetings with a helpful summary of notes recorded in the last three months and the most recent email thread on the timeline of the related record.

1. In the Copilot side pane or page, select the sparkle icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/sparkle-icon.png" border="false":::) and select **Stay ahead** >  **Prepare for sales appointments** to view the list of meetings scheduled on your calendar for the next 24 hours. One of the following happens: 

    - If you are in the context of a record, you'll see the list of sales appointments related to that record. 
    
    - If you're in the grid view or the Copilot page, you'll see all your sales appointments. 
    
1. From the list of sales appointments, hover over the meeting that you'd like to prepare for and select **Prepare**.

    If you only have one meeting coming up in the next 24 hours, it's summarized automatically.

## Show emails you haven't replied to

Copilot can help ensure that you don't miss important emails by reminding you of emails that you haven't replied to.

In the Copilot side pane or page, select the sparkle icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/sparkle-icon.png" border="false":::) and select **Stay ahead** >  **Show emails that need follow up**. One of the following happens: 

- If you are in the context of a record, you'll see the list of unanswered emails related to that record. 

- If you're in the grid view or the Copilot page, you'll see all your unanswered emails. 

To be included in the list, emails must meet the following criteria:

- They've been in your mailbox, unanswered, for the past three to seven days. Email that's been unanswered for longer than seven days falls off the list.
- They contain a buying intent, a question, a query, or an action item.
- They have the **Regarding** field as a lead or an opportunity.
