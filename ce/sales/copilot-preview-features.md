# Turn on preview features for Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales

Instead of turning on Copilot preview features in Dynamics 365 Sales individually, you can turn them all on at once. This article describes how to do that, and lists the Copilot preview features that are available.

## Copilot preview features

Preview features aren't meant for production use and might have restricted functionality. These features are made available to get early feedback from customers.

Typically, you turn on Dynamics 365 preview features individually in [Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/what-are-preview-features-how-do-i-enable-them). To make it easier, we added an option that turns on all the Copilot preview features in Dynamics 365 Sales with a single click.

The following table lists the Copilot preview features that are available in Dynamics 365 Sales.

| Preview feature | Description |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Copilot for Email | [Compose and send email messages using Copilot](compose-send-email-copilot.md). |

## Turn on all Copilot preview features

1. In the Sales Hub app, go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page and select **App Settings**.

1. Under **General Settings**, select **Copilot**.

1. In the **Set up Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales** page, turn on **Try our newest preview features before they're rolled out to everyone**.

1. Select **Publish**.
