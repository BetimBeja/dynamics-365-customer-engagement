# Preview features for Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales

Instead of enabling each preview feature individually, you can enable all the Copilot features in Dynamics 365 Sales at once. This topic lists the Copilot preview features and provides instructions to sign up for all the Copilot preview features in Dynamics 365 Sales.

## Preview features overview

Preview features aren't meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.Typically, all Dynamics 365 preview features are enabled from [Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/what-are-preview-features-how-do-i-enable-them).
