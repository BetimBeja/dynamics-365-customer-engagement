# Enable preview features for Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales

Instead of enabling each preview feature individually, you can enable all the Copilot features in Dynamics 365 Sales at once. This article lists the Copilot preview features and provides instructions to sign up for all the Copilot preview features in Dynamics 365 Sales.

## Copilot preview features

Preview features aren't meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are made available to get early feedback from customers. Typically, all Dynamics 365 preview features are enabled from [Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/what-are-preview-features-how-do-i-enable-them). Admins must enable each preview feature individually. To make it easier for admins, we've added an option that enables all the Copilot preview features in Dynamics 365 Sales with a single click.

The following table lists the Copilot preview features that are currently available in Dynamics 365 Sales.

| Preview feature | Description |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Copilot for Email | Compose and send email messages using Copilot. [Learn more](compose-send-email-copilot.md). |
