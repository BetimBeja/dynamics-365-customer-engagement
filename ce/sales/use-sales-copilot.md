## Open Copilot

You can open Copilot as a side pane, in the context of a record, such as an opportunity or lead, or in a full-screen view.

### Open Copilot in the side pane

Open the Copilot side pane when you want to get quick insights about a record or ask Copilot to summarize other records, display recent changes, and prepare for meetings, without leaving the current page. 

1. Select the **Copilot** icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/copilot-icon.png" border="false":::) on the right side of your app. You can open the **Copilot** side pane from any page in your app, except the **Copilot** page.

### Open Copilot in full-screen view

Open the Copilot page in full-screen view when you want more space and focus to chat with Copilot and ask questions.

1. Select **Copilot** from your sitemap.  If you don't see **Copilot** in your sitemap, ask your administrator to turn on the Copilot preview feature flag.
