# Use Copilot in Dynamics 365 apps

Copilot is an AI assistant that helps you be more productive and efficient in your daily work in Dynamics 365 Sales apps. Copilot can summarize information about your leads and opportunities, help you catch up on recent changes to your records, prepare for meetings, and enrich your leads with information from other sources.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | [Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | [Any primary sales role, such as Salesperson or Sales Manager](security-roles-for-sales.md#primary-sales-roles) |

## Prerequisites

Your admin has [turned on and set up Copilot](enable-setup-copilot.md).

## Open Copilot

You can open Copilot in a [side pane](#open-copilot-in-a-side-pane)&mdash;side-by-side with a record such as an opportunity or a lead&mdash;or in a [full-screen view](#open-copilot-immersive).

### Open Copilot in a side pane

Open the Copilot side pane when you want to get quick insights about a record or ask Copilot to summarize other records, display recent changes, and prepare for meetings without leaving the current page.

1. Select the **Copilot** icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/copilot-icon.svg" border="false":::) on the right side of your app. You can open the **Copilot** side pane from any page in your app except for the **Copilot** page.

1. Select a prompt from the suggestion list or select the sparkle icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/sparkle-icon.png" border="false":::) to get a list of suggested requests, or *prompts*, that Copilot can help you with. [Learn more about the prompts](#chat-with-copilot).

### Open Copilot in full-screen view (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner-section](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note.md)]

Open the Copilot page in a full-screen view when you want more space and focus to chat with Copilot and ask questions. 

1. Select **Copilot** in your site map.

   If it isn't there, ask your admin to [turn on Copilot preview features](copilot-preview-features.md#turn-on-all-copilot-preview-features). If you're using a custom app, ask your admin to [add the Copilot page to your app's site map](enable-setup-copilot.md#add-the-copilot-page-site-map-entry-to-custom-sales-app).

2. Select a prompt from the suggestion list or select the sparkle icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/sparkle-icon.png" border="false":::) to get a list of suggested requests, or *prompts*, that Copilot can help you with. [Learn more about the prompts](#chat-with-copilot).
