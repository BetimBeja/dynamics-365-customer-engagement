# Use Copilot in Dynamics 365 apps

Copilot is an AI assistant that helps you be more productive and efficient in your daily work in Dynamics 365 Sales apps. Copilot can summarize information about your leads and opportunities, help you catch up on recent changes to your records, prepare for meetings, and enrich your leads with information from other sources.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | [Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | [Any primary sales role, such as Salesperson or Sales Manager](security-roles-for-sales.md#primary-sales-roles) |

## Prerequisites

Your admin has [turned on and set up Copilot](enable-setup-copilot.md).

## Open Copilot

You can open Copilot in a side pane, side-by-side with a record such as an opportunity or a lead. We refer to this view as using Copilot *in context*. You can also open Copilot in a full-screen view, which we refer to as using Copilot *out of context*. [Learn more about how Copilot responds when in context and out of context](use-copilot-new.md).

### Open Copilot in a side pane

Open the Copilot side pane when you want to get quick insights about a record or ask Copilot to summarize other records, display recent changes, and prepare for meetings without leaving the current page.

1. Select the **Copilot** icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/copilot-icon.png" border="false":::) on the right side of your app. You can open the **Copilot** side pane from any page in your app except the **Copilot** page.

1. Select the sparkle icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/sparkle-icon.png" border="false":::) to get a list of suggested requests, or *prompts*, that Copilot can help you with.

### Open Copilot in full-screen view (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner-section](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note.md)]

Open the Copilot page in full-screen view when you want more space and focus to chat with Copilot and ask questions.

1. Select **Copilot** in your sitemap.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sales-copilot-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Copilot page showing suggested requests, with the Copilot icons in the left and right side panes highlighted.":::

    If it isn't there, ask your admin to [turn on Copilot preview features](copilot-preview-features.md#enable-all-preview-features-for-copilot). If you're using a custom app, ask your admin to [add the Copilot page to your app's sitemap](enable-setup-copilot.md#add-the-copilot-page-to-custom-apps-preview).

2. Select the sparkle icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/sparkle-icon.png" border="false":::) to get a list of suggested requests, or *prompts*, that Copilot can help you with.

## Chat with Copilot

Use predefined prompts to get the most out of Copilot.

- [Get information from Copilot](copilot-get-information.md)
- [Ask questions to Copilot](copilot-ask-questions.md)
- [Stay ahead with Copilot](copilot-stay-ahead.md)
