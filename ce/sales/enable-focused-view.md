# Enable focused view in your organization

Enable the focused view for your organization to allow sellers to easily manage records and associated activities on one page. By default, the option is enabled. Further, you can configure entities to show the focused view.  
When disabled, the focused view becomes unavailable for any entity within your organization. The configured entities won't display the focused view.

You must have the **System Administrator** or similar security role to perform these configurations. 

## Enable focused view 

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
1. Select your environment.
1. Select **Settings** > **Product** > **Features**.
1. Under the **Grids and views** section, turn on the **Enable focused view for all records** toggle.

    > To disable focused view, turn off the **Enable focused view for all records** toggle.

1. Save and publish your changes.

   Focused view is now enabled for your organization.
