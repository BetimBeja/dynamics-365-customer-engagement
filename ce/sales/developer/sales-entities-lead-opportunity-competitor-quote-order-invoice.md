# Sales tables (lead, opportunity, competitor, quote, order, and invoice)

You use the entities described in this section to manage various phases of a sales process. They include tracking leads, opportunities, competitors, and managing quotes, orders, products, and sales goals.  

> [!NOTE]
> As a developer or system customizer, you can update values in these tables [using the Web API](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/webapi/overview), even if the fields or forms are marked as read-only in the user interface. However, you must be aware of the implications of changing these values. We recommend that you test your changes in a development environment before deploying them to a production environment.
