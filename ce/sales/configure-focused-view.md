# Configure focused view

In focused view, sellers can view and manage their CRM records and their associated activities on one page. This view makes it easier for sellers to stay focused on their tasks, saving time by eliminating the need to navigate through multiple screens. It also allows sellers to better organize and prioritize their tasks.

As an administrator, you can do the following configuration for focused view:

- [Enable focused view in your organization](enable-focused-view.md)
- [Configure focused view as default](set-focused-view-as-default.md)

To understand how users can view and manage records in focused view, see [View and manage records in focused view](focused-view.md).
