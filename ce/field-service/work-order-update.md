# AI-powered work order update

Work Order Update is a new Copilot powered feature for the new User Interface of Field Service Mobile.  This feature allows Frontline Workers in the application to describe work performed in natural language using standard text entry or speech-to-text capabilities â€“ with this Input, Copilot will recommend updates to fields within the user interface which are then updated after confirmation.  

Work Order Update (preview) can update the following fields in the new user interface:

- Booking Status

- Booking Times

- Work Order Service Task Completion

- Work Order Products Quantity

- Work Order Products Line Status

- Work Order Service Duration

- Work Order Service Line Status

This feature is accessed from an entry point on the Booking form within the new mobile user experience.

This feature is available in North American and GBR environments only at this time.  

This feature is enabled via Admin toggle within the Field Service Mobile app module Settings and is only available when the new Field Service Mobile user experience is toggled on.
