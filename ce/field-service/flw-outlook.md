# Work with Field Service in Outlook (frontline managers)

Dynamics 365 Field Service provides an Outlook add-in for frontline managers to create, view, and edit work orders directly from their email. Without leaving Outlook, you can quickly respond to requests for service or questions about existing requests. The add-in provides copilot AI assistance to quickly create a work order with the information from the email. Then you can see suggested schedules so you can quickly select and book a technician. You can also create a work order manually and use the [Field Service schedule board](work-with-schedule-board.md) for scheduling.

## Install the Field Service for Outlook add-in

Your admin might have installed the add-in for your organization. If you see the Field Service icon in your email actions or **Field Service** in an email's **More actions** (**&hellip;**) menu, you can skip this step.

### Prerequisites

- You have either Outlook on the web or Outlook 2013 or later on Windows or macOS.
- You have a license for both Outlook and Dynamics 365 Field Service. If you don't have one, contact your organization's IT administrator.
- Your environment is in a [supported geography, region, and language](flw-overview.md#supported-geographies-regions-and-languages)
  > [!NOTE]
  > The supported language is based on your Outlook language. If you access Outlook from the web, the language is based on the web browser. If you access Outlook from Outlook Desktop, the language is based on Outlook Desktop's language.

### Install the Outlook Add-in

1. Go to [Microsoft AppSource](https://aka.ms/fieldserviceaddin) and select **Dynamics 365 Field Service for Outlook**.
