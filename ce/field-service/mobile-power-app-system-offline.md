# Mobile offline capabilities

Often frontline workers need to work in areas without internet access like remote areas or underground. The Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app offers offline capabilities through a mobile offline profile. When an admin [configures an offline profile](mobile-power-app-system-offline-setup.md), frontline workers can continue using the Field Service mobile app when there's no internet connection. With offline capabilities, important data syncs to the device for viewing when there's no internet connection. Changes on the device are stored locally and then they sync with the server when an active internet connection becomes available. For more information, see [Best practices for offline mode](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/administrator/2023/11/06/best-practices-for-offline-mode-in-the-field-service-mobile-app-part-1/).

> [!TIP]
> Configuring offline capabilities creates a fast and consistent experience and is strongly recommended.

The offline profile manages offline record types, relationships, and user assignments. For a guided walkthrough, check out the following video.

Field Service mobile follows the same architecture and security as the Power Apps mobile app. For more information, see [Overview of Power Platform security](/power-platform/admin/security/overview#the-application-and-data-on-the-device).

## Implementation guidance for the offline profile

Before configuring the offline profile, consider these important guidelines.

- **Use the default offline profile**. Although you can create your own mobile offline profile, we highly recommend using the default offline profile included with Field Service. The **Field Service Mobile - Offline Profile** provides an ideal starting point for offline configuration. It has common Field Service tables preconfigured along with some recommended filters to limit data. Use this profile and build upon it by including your custom record types. Limit the amount of data in the offline profile for sync performance.

  Using the default offline profile allows your offline profile to receive updates to unchanged table sync filters. You can copy the default profile and make changes to the copy, but the system considers the copy unmanaged. The copy won't receive any updates. If you make changes to the default offline profile and want to see the latest offline profile, create a new trial of Field Service to view it.

- **Avoid removing default record types from the offline profile**. We purposefully added default record types to ensure the right data is available to the frontline worker. Focus on adding the record types you need to the offline profile rather than removing ones you don't need.

- **Avoid using "All records" as an offline filter**. The offline profile is the gate that controls the amount of data downloaded to the frontline workersâ€™ devices. Technically, there's no limit to the number of records the offline profile supports. However, to keep sync times fast and efficient, avoid including "All records" as a table filter and avoid wide date ranges. For example, rather than downloading all customer asset records, download only the records related to scheduled work orders. It reduces the number of customer asset records without impacting work at hand. For optimal performance, we recommend that you follow the [offline profile guidelines](/power-apps/mobile/mobile-offline-guidelines).

- **Use offline JavaScript**. Organizations often need to run workflows on mobile devices to execute business processes. However, Power Automate flows only run when the device has network connection or on the next sync. Use offline JavaScript to run workflows on the device quickly and without internet access. For more information, see [Workflows and scripts for the Field Service mobile app](mobile-power-app-workflows.md).

For more best practices, see [Power Apps Mobile Offline Guidelines](/power-apps/mobile/mobile-offline-guidelines).

## Limitations of the offline profile

- Records created on the device in offline mode that don't meet filter conditions aren't resynchronized until the records meet the conditions.
- Commands or capabilities set up for internet connectivity must be reviewed and confirmed they're calling correct APIs: `Xrm.WebApi.online`.
- Tables that support offline are part of the default **Field Service Mobile - Offline Profile**. Some Field service tables such as Purchase Order, Agreements, RTV, and RMA don't support offline profiles. Adding these tables and running the application while offline might result in errors in the mobile application.
- The **Field Service Mobile - Offline Profile** can have a maximum of 15 linked tables. This 15-link limit includes downstream tables. For example, if Table A has a relationship with Table B, C, D and Table B has a relationship with Table F, G, H. Table A has six relationships: B, C, D, F, G, and H.
- Inventory validation doesn't run without network connectivity.
- [Other platform supported capabilities and limitations](../mobile-app/mobile-offline-capabilities.md)
- Access to SharePoint documents isn't supported.
- Due to some current [limitations](/power-apps/mobile/offline-capabilities#limitations) of offline WebResources, we recommend using the [Power Apps component framework (PCF)](/powerapps/developer/component-framework/overview) to implement custom capabilities that work in the mobile app and in the browser.
