# Get started with Field Service in Teams (frontline managers)

To get started using Field Service in Teams, install the app, then sign-in.

## Prerequisites

Your environment is in a [supported geography, region, and language](flw-overview.md#supported-geographies-regions-and-languages).

> [!NOTE]
> The supported language is based on your Teams' language. If you access Teams from the web, the language is based on the web browser. If you access Teams from Teams Desktop, the language is based on Teams Desktop's language.

## Install the Field Service Teams app

Your admin might have installed the app for your organization. If you see the Field Service or Viva Connections icon in the Teams side rail or **Field Service** in the app list, you can skip this step.

[!INCLUDE [fsp-deploy-teams](../includes/fsp-deploy-teams.md)]

## Select your environment

1. In Teams, select **Apps** and select **Field Service**.

1. Select the **Settings** tab.

1. Select your Field Service environment. If you work in more than one environment, you can easily [switch environments](flw-teams-manager.md#switch-environments) when you need to.

1. Once the environment is validated, select one of the following:

   - The **Home** tab to go to the Teams **Home** page.
