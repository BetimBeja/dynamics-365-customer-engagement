## Service protection limits for AI suggestions

The AI suggestions for case and knowledge feature was introduced in October 2020 with service protection limits on these capabilities to maintain a consistent quality of service for all our customers. However, there aren't penalties if customers exceed predefined limits. Over time, Microsoft might adjust these limits in keeping with customer usage patterns. Microsoft provides options for customers with high usage scenarios and patterns to purchase more capacity in a manner that's minimally disruptive.

For information on the service protection limits for AI suggestions, see [Enable AI suggestions for similar cases and knowledge articles](csw-enable-ai-suggested-cases-knowledge-articles.md). The total limits are pooled at the tenant level based on the number of Customer Service Enterprise user licenses that are available in the tenant.

## Microsoft Power Platform capacity impact

If you enable the insights feature, it affects Dataverse entitlements. For more information, see [New Microsoft Dataverse storage capacity](/power-platform/admin/capacity-storage).
