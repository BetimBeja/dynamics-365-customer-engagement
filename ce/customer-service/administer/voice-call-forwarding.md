# Enable call forwarding

You can enable your agents with inbound profiles to forward calls to chosen external numbers when they are away from their desk. Perform the following steps to configure call forwarding:

1. Go to Customer Service admin center > User management > User profile.
2.	Specify the number to send calls to when the agent is offline in Omnichannel > Call forward. 

 Note: The transfer setting (bridged or non-bridged) in the inbound profile is used when forwarding the call. When the agentâ€™s presence is not offline or DND, calls will continue to be sent to their voicemail.
