# How to set pause conditions in SLA

Pause and resume SLAs at the SLA KPI level and SLA item level, which help track SLA items for different work hours based on priority and criteria. The pause settings at SLA KPI level or SLA item level give you added flexibility to define pause conditions at a more granular level.

In Unified Interface, pause conditions can be configured on global level, SLAKPI Level and SLA Item level.â€‹

<!--Next steps. Optional. Provide no more than three next steps. Include some context so the customer can determine why they would click the link.-->

## Define the pause criteria at the KPI level

Set the toggle to Yes for Override Criteria. If any pause settings are applied at the entity level for your org, they're overridden by the criteria define at the KPI level. For the other KPIs, the entity level pause settings continues to function if no pause criteria is defined at the KPI level.
Select Add to define the conditions in which the SLA KPI can be paused.
