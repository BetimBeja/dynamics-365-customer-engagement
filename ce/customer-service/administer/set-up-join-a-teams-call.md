# Set up Join a Teams call for agent conversations with customers (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](../../../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note.md)]

Join a Teams call is a feature that helps agents in your organization give their customers a more personalized support experience by using Teams to share their screen, connect through video, and offer remote control assistance. Customers donâ€™t need to have a Teams license or previous experience using Teams.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- Agents in your organization must be able to access and use Teams.
- Agents must be able to access the productivity pane to see the Join a Teams call app. More information: [Assign templates and enable the productivity pane and channels](create-agent-experience-profile#assign-users-templates-configure-productivity-pane-channels)
- If you want agents to be able to invite their customers to Teams meetings via email, agent email must be configured for outbound email.

## Set up the ability for agents to invite customers to join Teams calls

1.	In Power Platform admin center, go to **Settings** > **Product** > **Collaboration**, and then turn on the setting for **End users can join Teams meetings from appointments**.
   
1.	In Customer Service admin center, go to **Agent experience** > **Collaboration**.
	
1.	In **Join a Teams call**, select **Manage**.

1.	On the **Join a Teams call** page, turn on the setting for **Join a Teams call**.

1.	If you want to enable other agent profiles that aren't set by default to invite customers to join Teams calls, you must manually enable them. Select **Manage** next to **Turn on for specific multisession users.** More information: [Add the Teams chat setting page for specific multisession users](configure-teams-chat.md#add-the-teams-chat-settings-page-for-specific-multisession-users)

1. Save the changes. The Join a Teams call feature is now enabled in Customer Service workspace.
