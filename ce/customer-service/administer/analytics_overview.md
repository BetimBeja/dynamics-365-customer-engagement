# Use and customize analytics and insights

As an administrator, you have the ability to [enable analytics and insights](configure-customer-service-analytics-insights-csh.md#configure-analytics-and-insights-dashboards) features within Customer Service. These can then be shared with supervisors for review and analysis of contact center activities. This valuable information can help identify and address issues, improve agent efficiency, and ultimately enhance productivity and customer satisfaction.

You can configure these features and services in the Customer Service admin center app. Once set up, supervisors can access and view them from the Customer Service workspace app.

## Use out-of-the-box features

Customer Service provides a variety of default dashboards and reports. These dashboards display a range of charts, metrics, and key performance indicators, offering valuable insights into your contact center operations. Here's an overview of what's readily available to you.

### Access dashboards

Supervisors can access and view these dashboards from the Customer Service workspace app.

- [Customer Service historical analytics dashboards](../use/customer-service-analytics-insights-csh.md#customer-service-historical-analytics-reports)

- [Omnichannel historical analytics dashboards](../use/omnichannel-analytics-insights.md)

- [Omnichannel real-time analytics dashboards](../use/intro-realtime-analytics-dashboard.md#overview-of-omnichannel-real-time-analytics-dashboard)

- [Knowledge analytics reports](../use/knowledge-search-analytics-cs.md)

## Customize features

Here are the customizations that you can utilize.

- [Customize Key Performance Indicators](../use/customize-reports.md#customize-visual-display): Use the embedded Power BI editor to modify the visual display of dashboards, tailoring the out-of-the-box reports to your organization's needs.
- Personalize analytics:
    - [Report Filters and Groups](../use/report-filters-groups.md#report-filters-and-groups): Save time by setting one or more filters to a report group, eliminating the need to set filters each time you access the reports.
    - [Manage Bookmarks for Reports](../use/manage-bookmarks.md#manage-bookmarks-for-reports): Utilize bookmarks to save the filters you've set, allowing for easy viewing of specific data each time you open the report.
- [Utilize Omnichannel for Customer Service Metrics](../use/oc-metrics-dimensions.md#use-omnichannel-for-customer-service-metrics): Perform a quantitative assessment of the data displayed on the Omnichannel for Customer Service dashboards.
