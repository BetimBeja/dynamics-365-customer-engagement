# Overview of Analytics and Insights

As an administrator, you can enable Customer Service analytics and insights features and services and share them with supervisors, who can then view and analyze  activities at the contact center. Getting information about your contact center helps you mitigate issues and help agents enhance efficiency, thereby leading to productivity and customer satisfaction.

You can configure the features and services in the Customer Service admin center app, and then let your supervisors view them on the Customer Service workspace app.

## Out-of-the-box features

Customer Service offers you many dashboards and reports by default. These dashboards show various charts, metrics, and key performance indicators to help you gain insights into your contact center activities. Here's what's already available to you.

### Dashboards
- [Customer Service historical analytics dashboards](../use/customer-service-analytics-insights-csh.md#customer-service-historical-analytics-reports)

- [Omnichannel historical analytics dashboards](../use/omnichannel-analytics-insights.md)

- [Omnichannel real-time analytics dashboards](../use/intro-realtime-analytics-dashboard.md#overview-of-omnichannel-real-time-analytics-dashboard)

- [Knowledge analytics reports](../use/knowledge-search-analytics-cs.md)

## Customizations

Here are the customizations that you can leverage.

- [Visualize key performance indicators](../use/customize-reports.md#customize-visual-display): If you want to change the visual display of the dashboards, you can use an embedded Power BI editor to customize the out-of-the-box reports and meet your organizational requirements.
- Personalize analytics
    - [Report filters and groups](../use/report-filters-groups.md#report-filters-and-groups): You can set one or more filters to a report group and save time trying to set filters each time you access those reports.
    - [Manage bookmarks for reports](../use/manage-bookmarks.md#manage-bookmarks-for-reports): You can use bookmarks to save the filters that you might have set and easily view specific data every time you open the report.
- [Use Omnichannel for Customer Service metrics](../use/oc-metrics-dimensions.md#use-omnichannel-for-customer-service-metrics): You can use metrics to do a quantitative assessment of the data that is shown on the Omnichannel for Customer Service dashboards. You can use these metrics to [customize the visual display](../use/customize-reports.md#customize-visual-display) of your reports.
