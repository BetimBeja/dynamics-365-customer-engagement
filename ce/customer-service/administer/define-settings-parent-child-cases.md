# Define parent and child case settings

In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, you can track multiple issues for a customer, or track the same issue that's affecting multiple customers, using parent and child cases. For example, you could track a case where work needs to be done by other departments. The primary case or issue is called the **Parent** case. Any related cases are called **Child** cases. Before your service team can start using this feature, you need to go to **Service Management** and set up a few rules about how information is inherited. 

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_custsvcmgr_sysadmin_and_customizer](../../includes/proc-permissions-custsvcmgr-sysadmin-and-customizer.md)]

## Set parent and child case attributes

1. In Dynamics 365, go to one of the apps, and perform the following steps.
   
   ### [Customer Service admin center](#tab/customerserviceadmincenter)
     
     1. In the site map, select **Case Settings** in **Customer Support**. The **Case Settings** page appears.
     
     1. Select **Manage** for **Parent child case settings**.

   ### [Customer Service Hub](#tab/customerservicehub)
   
     - In the **Service Management** site map, select **Case Settings** in **Parent Child Case Settings**.  
  
2. In the **Case Settings** dialog, enter the following details:

    a. In **Select the attributes**, you must select the mandatory case attributes such as **Case Title** and **Customer**. The child case will inherit these attributes.

      You can view **Available** and **Selected** attributes in two lists; use the arrows **>**, **<**, **>>**, and **<<** to move the attributes from one list to another. 
  
    b. In **Specify closure preference**, select a case closure setting that defines how parent and child cases are closed. Select one of the case closure options for parent and child cases:  
  
   - **Close all child cases when parent case is closed**: As soon as the parent case is closed, all the child cases are also closed.
   - **Don't allow parent case closure until all child cases are closed**: The parent case canâ€™t be closed until all the child cases are closed.

    c. In **Maximum number of child cases**, specify a number that denotes the number of child cases a parent case can have.

      > [!Note]
      > We recommend that you specify a smaller value for **Maximum number of child cases** to avoid performance issues when cases are resolved or merged.

3. Select **Save**.
