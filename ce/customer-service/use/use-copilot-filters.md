# Use Copilot filters

Copilot filters help you generate responses based on a specific set of topics. Filters provide immediate context and reduce the chance of getting irrelevant responses.
 
Based on your administrators settings, in the Copilot help pane for the ask a question the following are applicable:

 - You can select filters to refine the responses generated by Copilot.
 - View automated filters applied based current record your are working on. You can change and edit these filters as required.

For example, your organization has several departments and you work only on credit card related queries. If you apply the credit card filter, Copilot retrieves only the relevant credit card content from the knowledge source and which is then used to generate responses. 

If your administrator has enabled automated filters for the case based on the location of the customer's account, Copilot applies the filter automatically when you open the case. You can change the filter as required.

When both the filters are applied, Copilot generates responses based on both the filters.

To apply a filter, perform the following steps:

- Select **Filters** on the Copilot pane. The **Select filters** menu appears.
- Select the required options. You can also search for a filter option.
- Select **Apply**.

Once you set a filter, the following actions are applicable:
- A message indicating the filters are applied when Copilot generates new responses appears on the Copilot pane. This message also appears whenever you modify the filter configuration.

- A visual indicator for the automated filter is displayed.
- The filters set apply to the following Copilot features: ask a question, draft a chat, and email.
- The filter is saved. You don't have to set the filter each time you log in.
