# Use enhanced email attachment experience across forms

If your administrator has enabled the [enhanced attachment control](../administer/add-enhanced-attachment-control.md), you will see a consistent email attachment experience across forms. You can perform the following actions when the enhanced email attachment control is enabled:

- Select **Add** to add files.
- Drag and drop files to the attachment control, email body, or rich text editor to be added as attachments.
- View the size of the uploaded attachment in the nearest unit of its size.
- Hover over the attachment to download, delete, or select an attachment.
- Select the file to launch the preview. Preview is available only for image and pdf attachments.
- Switch between the grid and list views.
- **Select all** to select all the attachments.
- Copy multiple attachments from various emails and paste them into a single email. The application displays the total number of attachments that were copied across multiple emails and pasted to the target email.
