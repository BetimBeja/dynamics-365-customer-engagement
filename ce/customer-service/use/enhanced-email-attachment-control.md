# Use enhanced experience to attach files to emails

You can drag files to be added as email attachments or copy attachments from one email to another, allowing you to efficiently manage email attachments. 

## Prerequisites

Your administrator must enable **Attachments control** in Power Apps.

## Use the enhanced email attachment experience
 
You can perform the following actions when the enhanced email attachment control is enabled:

- Add files.
- Drag files to the attachment control, email body, or rich text editor to be added as attachments. When you drag image files to rich text editor, they are added as inline images.
- View the size of the uploaded attachment in the nearest unit of its size.
- Hover over the attachment to download, delete, or select an attachment.
- Select the file to launch the preview. Preview is available only for image and pdf attachments.
- Switch between the grid and list views.
- Select all the attachments.
- Copy multiple attachments from various emails and paste them into a single email. The application displays the total number of attachments that you copied across multiple emails and pasted to the target email.
