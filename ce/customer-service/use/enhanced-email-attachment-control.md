# Use enhanced experience to attach files to emails

When you are composing an email, you can drag files and add them as attachments and copy attachments from one email to another.

## Prerequisites

Your administrator has enabled the enhanced attachment control.

## Use the enhanced experience to attach files
 
Perform the following actions using the enhanced email attachment control:

- Add files.
- Drag files to the attachment control, email body, or rich text editor to be added as attachments. When you drag image files to rich text editor, they are added as inline images.
- View the size of the uploaded attachment in the nearest unit of its size.
- Hover over the attachment to download, delete, or select an attachment.
- Select the file to launch the preview. Preview is available only for image and pdf attachments.
- Switch between the grid and list views.
- Select all the attachments.
- Copy multiple attachments from various emails and paste them into a single email. The application displays the total number of attachments that you copied across multiple emails and pasted to the target email.
