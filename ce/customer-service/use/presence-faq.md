# FAQ on agent presence in Customer Service

This article tries to answer the questions that you might have on agent presence to help you understand the feature better.

## What happens when agent changes presence manually during a conversation

To understand how presence works, see [How do manual and automatic presence updates work together](oc-manage-presence-status.md#how-do-manual-and-automatic-presence-updates-work-together).

## What presence does the agent have outside of working hours

The system displays the agent presence status as long as they are signed in to Customer Service workspace.

## What presence will an agent have when they sign in from multiple browsers

The same presence status will persist across the different browsers. We recommend that agents don't sign in from multiple browsers.

## Does presence change if agent gets into a consult chat or call

Presence status is unaffected when agent joins a consult.

## What happens to presence when agents don't close conversations properly

Stuck conversations can result in incorrect presence status because capacity is also blocked.

## Is presence affected when agents refresh their browser

Agent status remains the same when they refresh their browser.

## How is presence affected when agents experience network issues

See [how presence status is updated](oc-manage-presence-status.md#how-presence-status-is-updated) to understand the behavior during network issues.

## Does presence load when agents have custom roles

See the [prerequisites](oc-manage-presence.md#prerequisites) that are required for the presence status to load correctly.
