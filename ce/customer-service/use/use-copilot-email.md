# Write an email with Copilot

When you draft customer emails, Copilot can offer suggestions to make them clearer, more concise, and more compelling. Based on your administrator's settings, you can launch the **Write an email** feature in Copilot as follows:

- When you respond to an email in the rich text editor, select the Copilot control to view the capabilities inline.
- When you open an email, select the **Copilot help pane** and then select **Write an email** tab.

## Use Copilot to draft an email

When you use Copilot to draft an email, you can use the following features to help you write a response to a customer:

### Use prompts

- **Suggest a call**: Drafts a reply that suggests a call with the customer the same day or the next day.
- **Request more information**: Drafts a reply that requests more details from the customer to help resolve the problem.
- **Empathize with feedback**: Drafts a reply that provides an empathetic response to a customer who expresses a complaint.
- **Provide product/service details**: Drafts a reply that offers details or answers customer questions about a particular product or service.
- **Resolve the customer's problem**: Drafts a reply that provides a resolution&mdash;and resolution steps, if applicable&mdash;to the customer's problem.
- **Custom**: Allows you to provide your own prompt for the reply.

> [!NOTE]
> If your administrator has not enabled knowledge base, you will see the **Suggest a call**, **Request more information**, **Empathize with feedback**, and **Custom** prompts only.

### Use filters

You can select **Filters** to choose only the relevant knowledge articles that Copilot must use to generate the response.

### How Copilot uses knowledge base and web sources

If your administrator has enabled Knowledge sources and set up trusted domains, the following actions occur:
-  Copilot uses internal knowledge base sources and searches the internal knowledge base and up to five trusted domains to generate email drafts. 
- The application displays the knowledge sources used to generate the draft when you select **Check sources**.
- When you use a custom prompt to further refine the response, the application displays the **Use knowledge base** toggle that's set to **On**. You can switch the toggle to **Off** to disable knowledge base sources.

### Review suggested replies

When you select one of the prompts, Copilot generates a suggested reply. *Always review the response.* 

### Refine replies

You can select **Adjust** to change the length and tone of the response as follows:

**Length**: Select Short, Medium, or Long to condense or expand on your text.
**Tone**: Select Friendly, Professional, or Formal to adjust the tone of your text.

### Use follow-up prompts

If Copilot's response isn't immediately useful, you can use follow-up custom prompts and guide Copilot in a natural, conversational way. You can refine responses using up to five prompts. If your administrator has enabled knowledge base, Copilot will use those sources to refine the responses.

### Translate the response

Select **Translate** to see translate the email response to a customer's language. Select **Show original** to see the response in its original language.

### Use the responses

To use the draft that Copilot has generated, do the following:
- In the rich text editor, select **Keep it**. You'll see the draft in the rich text editor that you can use as-is or further edit before sending it to the customer.
- In the Copilot pane, you can:
    - Select **Edit** to further refine the response.
    - Select **Copy** to copy the response and then paste it to the email body.

### Start over

To return to the choice of six prompts, select **Start over** at the bottom of the Copilot pane.
