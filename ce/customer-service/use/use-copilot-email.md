# Write an email with Copilot

When you draft customer emails, Copilot can offer suggestions to make them clearer, more concise, and more compelling. Based on your administrator's settings, you can launch the **Write an email** feature in Copilot as follows:

- When you respond to an email in the rich text editor, select the Copilot control to view the capabilities inline.
- When you open an email, select the **Copilot help pane** and then select **Write an email** tab.

## Use Copilot to draft an email

When you use Copilot to draft an email, you can use the following features to help you write a response to a customer:

### Use prompts

- **Suggest a call**: Drafts a reply that suggests a call with the customer the same day or the next day.
- **Request more information**: Drafts a reply that requests more details from the customer to help resolve the problem.
- **Empathize with feedback**: Drafts a reply that provides an empathetic response to a customer who expresses a complaint.
- **Provide product/service details**: Drafts a reply that offers details or answers customer questions about a particular product or service.
- **Resolve the customer's problem**: Drafts a reply that provides a resolution&mdash;and resolution steps, if applicable&mdash;to the customer's problem.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Provide product/service details** and **Resolve the customer's problem** prompts only use context from case, email, and knowledge base articles to generate email responses.

- **Custom**: Allows you to provide your own prompt for the reply.

### Use filters

You can select **Filters** to choose only the relevant knowledge articles that Copilot must use to generate the response.

### How Copilot uses knowledge base and web sources

If your administrator has enabled Knowledge sources and set up trusted domains, Copilot uses internal knowledge base sources and searches the internal knowledge base and up to five trusted domains to generate email drafts. Select **Check sources** to see the knowledge sources used to generate the draft.

### Review suggested replies

When you select one of the prompts, Copilot generates a suggested reply. *Always review the response.* 

### Refine replies

You can select **Adjust** to change the length and tone of the response as follows:

**Length**: Select Short, Medium, or Long to condense or expand on your text.
**Tone**: Select Friendly, Professional, or Formal to adjust the tone of your text.

### Use follow-up prompts

If Copilot's response isn't immediately useful, you can use follow-up prompts and guide Copilot in a natural, conversational way. You can refine responses using up to five follow-up prompts. If your administrator has enabled knowledge base, Copilot will use those sources to refine the responses.

### Translate the response

Select **Translate** to see translate the email response to a customer's language. Select **Show original** to see the response in its original language.

### Use the responses

To use the draft that Copilot has generated, do the following:
- Select **Keep it** in the rich text editor.
- Select **Copy** and then paste it to the email if you want to copy the draft email from the Copilot pane and then paste it to your email body. 

### Start over

To return to the choice of six prompts, select **Start over** at the bottom of the Copilot pane.
